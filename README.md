# A yeoman generator for Twitter Bootstrap with LESS

## Installation

* Copy the bootstrap-less folder into one of your yeoman's generators folder.

It works fine with your yeoman's installation folder : 
`[yeoman_installation_folder]/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators`

* create a new project folder
  ```sh
  $ mkdir project-x
  $ cd project-x
  ```

* Install [grunt-recess](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-recess) in your project directory
  ```sh
  $ npm install grunt-recess
  ```

* Init your project with the new yeoman generator
  ```sh
  $ yeoman init bootstrap-less
    ```

* done
